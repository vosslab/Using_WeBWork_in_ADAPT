# Changelog

## 2026-01-12
- Expanded `README.md` with repository layout, topic coverage, and usage guidance
  based on the Insight-HTML exports.
- Replaced `README.md` with the chapter expansion plan for the `Textbook/` guide.
- Removed autogenerated `Textbook/00_Front_Matter/` and `Textbook/99_Back_Matter/` folders to
  avoid confusion about where editable content belongs.
- Filled previously-empty chapter HTML files and expanded existing chapter pages with PGML-first,
  science-focused guidance using the local Insight/WebWorK HTML archives as source material.
- Added `tools/html_lint_checker.py` (lxml-based) and `tests/run_html_lint.sh` to lint textbook HTML
  for LibreTexts compatibility (no links, no JavaScript).
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the repo intent (textbook/guide) and the HTML authoring constraints.
- Updated `README.md` plan to reflect the no-link rule and removal of front/back matter.
- Added a new Chapter 1 comparison page and a brief comparison section in Chapter 1.2 to position
  WeBWorK against other autograded formats (H5P, QTI, LMS banks, etc.).
- Updated the Chapter 1.4 comparison table to use LibreTexts responsive table markup while keeping
  explicit column widths.
- Added `docs/LIBRETEXTS_HTML_GUIDE.md` documenting the standard LibreTexts-compatible table format
  and other HTML authoring rules for `Textbook/`.
