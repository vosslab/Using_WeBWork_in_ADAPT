<p>
WeBWorK problems are written in PG, but in this guide the goal is not to turn instructors into
Perl programmers. Regular PG is treated as the minimum setup needed to support a clean PGML
prompt: define a few variables, define answer checkers, and let PGML carry the student-facing
text.
</p>

<h2>What "PG" is used for (in this guide)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Load macros needed for PGML and answer checking.</li>
	<li>Choose an appropriate MathObjects context.</li>
	<li>Generate a small number of randomized values.</li>
	<li>Compute the target answer(s) and configure the answer checkers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What "regular PG" is not used for (in this guide)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Writing the prompt as long blocks of <code>BEGIN_TEXT/END_TEXT</code>.</li>
	<li>Building complex formatting by hand (PGML is preferred).</li>
	<li>Large "programs" inside a single question.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How this chapter fits the book</h2>
<p>
Chapter 2 exists because every PGML problem still needs some PG scaffolding (macros, variables,
answers). The goal is to keep that scaffolding short, readable, and reusable.
