Most WeBWorK authoring time is not spent on the "main math", but on the predictable failure modes:
an answer blank is not bound to the intended grader, a unit or format expectation is unclear, or
randomization generates a broken biology scenario. This section collects a small set of checks that
catch most failures quickly.
</p>

<h2>Answer blank binding and ordering</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prefer attaching answers directly to blanks in PGML: <code>[_____]{...}</code>.</li>
	<li>For multi-part prompts, keep one target quantity per blank.</li>
	<li>Preview the problem and confirm each blank grades the intended thing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Text answers (biology terminology) that cause grading disputes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Decide what you will accept for plural/singular (mitochondrion/mitochondria).</li>
	<li>Decide how you will treat hyphens and spacing (Gram-positive vs Gram positive).</li>
	<li>If abbreviations are acceptable, include them explicitly (DNA vs deoxyribonucleic acid).</li>
	<li>For gene/protein names, state whether case matters and whether symbols or full names are expected.</li>
	<li>When spelling is not the point, use recognition-style items (MC/MATCH) instead of free text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Units and reporting expectations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>State units in the prompt and repeat the expected units next to the answer blank.</li>
	<li>Use one unit system per question whenever possible.</li>
	<li>State rounding or decimal-place expectations when they matter for grading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tolerances and "nearly correct" answers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Set tolerances intentionally (absolute vs relative) and keep them consistent with your reporting rules.</li>
	<li>Test boundary cases: values just inside/outside tolerance, common rounding choices, and common unit mistakes.</li>
	<li>When students keep retrying, the issue is often unclear expectations rather than hard content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Randomization and biological plausibility</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Constrain random values to avoid impossible scenarios (negative concentrations, invalid probabilities, etc.).</li>
	<li>Avoid values that force awkward repeating decimals unless you want to grade with tolerance.</li>
	<li>Preview multiple variants and spot-check the story, units, and answer reasonableness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Log-scale traps (pH, Ct, fold change)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>State what quantity you want (for example pH vs [H+]).</li>
	<li>State the model and base when needed (for example Ct differences under a 2x-per-cycle assumption).</li>
	<li>State the reporting format (Ct, delta Ct, fold change, log2 fold change) to avoid multiple interpretations.</li>
</ul>
