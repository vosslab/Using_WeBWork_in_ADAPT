<p>
This section is a practical ADAPT checklist for creating, testing, and assigning WeBWorK problems.
It is written for copy-edit workflows: start from a working item, make small changes, and test
until the student view and grading are stable.
</p>

<h2>Workflow overview</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create or clone a question into your personal question area.</li>
	<li>Edit the code and metadata.</li>
	<li>Preview and revise until the prompt, answers, and scoring behave correctly.</li>
	<li>Add the question to an assignment.</li>
	<li>Reorder questions, adjust points, and publish.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Checklist for a new WeBWorK question</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Start from a working PGML-first template (do not start from a blank file).</li>
	<li>Keep PG setup minimal: values, context, answer objects, graders.</li>
	<li>Write the prompt in PGML and attach answers to blanks.</li>
	<li>Use a realistic life science story and keep the story stable across randomization.</li>
	<li>Verify units, reporting expectations, and tolerance settings.</li>
	<li>Preview multiple variants to ensure randomization stays valid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding and reusing questions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Search for an existing question close to what you want.</li>
	<li>Clone before editing so you keep the original as a reference.</li>
	<li>Keep a small set of personal templates you trust and reuse them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding questions to assignments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Add questions from multiple sources (search, shared banks, your question area).</li>
	<li>Reorder questions to match your intended progression.</li>
	<li>Adjust points only after you have confirmed the question behavior.</li>
</ul>
