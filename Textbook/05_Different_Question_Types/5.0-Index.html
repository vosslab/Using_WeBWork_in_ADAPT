This chapter is the bridge between WeBWorK authoring and using WeBWorK inside ADAPT. It collects
common question interaction patterns (question types) and pairs them with a practical workflow and
a short QA checklist so you can ship reliable assignments without surprises.
</p>

<p>
WeBWorK problems are authored using PG (a Perl-based setup layer) and PGML (a markup layer for the
student-facing prompt). In this guide, PG is treated as minimal scaffolding and PGML is the
default authoring style.

<p>
Life-science-first emphasis: examples and checklists are written to answer "what breaks when the
content is biology?" and to prioritize patterns that grade reliably for biology-style prompts.
