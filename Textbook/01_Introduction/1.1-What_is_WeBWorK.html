<p>
The name "WeBWorK" is derived from the combination of "Web" and "Homework." It reflects the
system's primary function of delivering and managing homework assignments over the web. The
project started in the mid-1990s at the University of Rochester.
</p>

<p>
In practice, WeBWorK is a system for delivering automatically graded questions where the student
experience is a web page and the author experience is a text-based problem file (usually a
<code>.pg</code> file). A problem can randomize values, format mathematical content, collect student
answers, and grade them immediately.
</p>

<h2>PGML-first authoring</h2>
<p>
WeBWorK problems are written in a language called PG, but most authors should treat "regular PG"
as the plumbing that sets up variables and answer checkers. The student-facing prompt should be
written in PGML (PG Markup Language), which is designed to replace older <code>BEGIN_TEXT</code>
authoring.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		PG (minimal): load macros, choose contexts, define random values, and build MathObjects.
	</li>
	<li>
		PGML (primary): write the prompt, math, tables, and answer blanks using readable markup.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it works well for sciences</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Short prompts with structured data (tables, values, units).</li>
	<li>Algorithmic variants for repeated practice without reusing the same numbers.</li>
	<li>Clear answer checking via MathObjects (numeric, formula, list, multiple choice).</li>
	<li>Consistent formatting for math and variables inside the prompt via PGML substitutions.</li>
</ul>
