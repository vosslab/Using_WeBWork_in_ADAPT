There are plenty of guides for writing mathematics assessment questions in WeBWorK. This guide
tries to take a different approach and is written for an audience in the sciences and descriptive
fields. Neil Voss, the initial author of this guide, is a professor in life science, though he has
a background in mathematics and physics.

<h2>What this guide emphasizes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		PGML-first authoring: write the student-facing prompt in PGML and keep "regular PG"
		code to the minimum needed to support PGML.
	</li>
	<li>
		Science-friendly prompts: units, significant figures, tabular data, and story problems that match
		lab and lecture workflows.
	</li>
	<li>
		Practical reuse: patterns you can clone and modify to build question banks quickly and safely.
	</li>
</ul>
