This section is a curated "further techniques" list for authors who need more than the PGML-first
baseline. It intentionally focuses on patterns that are most relevant to life science prompts
(tables, strings, custom feedback, and robustness) rather than advanced calculus or graphics.
</p>

<h2>Patterns worth knowing</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Strings in context</strong>: define a controlled set of acceptable words or labels when
		free text is necessary.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Data tables</strong>: present small datasets in an accessible format and compute from
		them.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Custom error messages</strong>: make grading feedback clearer when a common wrong
		interpretation appears repeatedly.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Answer hints</strong>: provide targeted feedback for one or two common errors without
		turning the problem into a tutor.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Adaptive parameters</strong>: adjust later parts of a problem based on earlier answers
		when you need scaffolded workflows.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical advice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use these techniques to reduce ambiguity and grading disputes, not to add complexity.</li>
	<li>When a technique is new to you, start by copy-editing a known working example.</li>
	<li>Preview multiple variants and test common student inputs before publishing.</li>
</ul>
