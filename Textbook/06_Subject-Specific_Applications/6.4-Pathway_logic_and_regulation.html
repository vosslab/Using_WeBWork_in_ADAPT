<p>
Pathway logic questions work best when you present a small, explicit system and test one inference
at a time. Matching and multiple answer items can work well here when distractors reflect common
misinterpretations.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Match pathway components to roles (enzyme, regulator, product).</li>
	<li>Select which perturbations increase or decrease an output (MA).</li>
	<li>Order a short set of steps in a pathway (ORDER) only when the sequence is truly standard.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Too many steps: the item becomes a reading test instead of a biology test.</li>
	<li>Ambiguous arrows: activation vs conversion vs transport without labels.</li>
	<li>Hidden assumptions about feedback that are not stated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PGML-first prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Provide a 4-step pathway with one inhibitor.
Ask: which intervention increases the final product?
