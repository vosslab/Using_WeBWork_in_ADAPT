<p>
qPCR questions often fail because Ct is already on a log-like scale and small mistakes become
large fold-change errors. Grading works best when you specify the model (doubling per cycle) and
the reporting format (Ct, delta Ct, or fold change).
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compute a delta Ct from two Ct values (NUM).</li>
	<li>Interpret which sample has higher expression (MC) based on Ct values.</li>
	<li>Multi-part: compute delta Ct and then report fold change under a stated model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Students treat a higher Ct as higher expression unless the prompt reminds them.</li>
	<li>The base of the fold-change model is not stated (2x per cycle vs other efficiencies).</li>
	<li>Answers differ by a factor of 2^n, causing tolerance-based grading to be meaningless.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PGML-first prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Data: Ct_control = 18.2, Ct_treatment = 21.2
Model: one cycle difference corresponds to a 2-fold change.
Task: report fold change (treatment relative to control).
