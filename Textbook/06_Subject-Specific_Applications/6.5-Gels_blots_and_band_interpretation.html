<p>
Gel and blot interpretation is a natural fit for structured prompts and ordering questions. These
problems become reliable when you separate the data description from the inference being graded.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Order bands by size when the relationship is unambiguous (ORDER).</li>
	<li>Multiple choice inference: which lane contains the largest fragment, or which sample is most
		expressed.</li>
	<li>Matching lane labels to conditions when the mapping is the main skill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Students reverse "migrates farther" and "larger" without explicit reminder of direction.</li>
	<li>Axes or markers are missing, forcing guessing.</li>
	<li>Images fail to render; prompts should remain solvable with a textual description of key
		observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prompt outline without relying on images</h2>
<pre>
Provide a small table: lane -> migration distance (mm).
Task: rank fragments from largest to smallest.
