<p>
Genotype-to-phenotype mapping is a good place to mix a short calculation with a concept check.
The key is to keep naming conventions and interpretation language explicit.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compute expected genotype frequencies, then select a phenotype statement (MC).</li>
	<li>Multi-part blanks: one blank for a fraction, one blank for an interpretation term.</li>
	<li>Matching: alleles or genotypes to phenotype descriptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Ambiguity: "dominant phenotype" without a defined phenotype.</li>
	<li>Format mismatch: fractions vs decimals; genotype notation styles (Aa vs A/a).</li>
	<li>Multiple reasonable interpretations when penetrance is implied but not stated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PGML-first prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Story: Aa x Aa cross with complete dominance.
Task 1: expected fraction of aa offspring.
Task 2: identify which genotype(s) show the recessive phenotype.
