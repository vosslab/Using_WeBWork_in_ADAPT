<p>
Pedigree and inheritance probability prompts work well when you keep the model assumptions
explicit and keep the computation small. This pattern pairs well with multi-part blanks and a
follow-up concept check.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compute a probability of a genotype given parental genotypes.</li>
	<li>Compute an expected count given a family size.</li>
	<li>Multiple choice interpretation: which inheritance model best matches the pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prompts imply autosomal vs sex-linked without stating it.</li>
	<li>Dominance assumptions are unclear or contradicted by the story.</li>
	<li>Students choose phenotype probabilities when genotype probabilities are requested.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PGML-first prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Story: autosomal recessive trait, carrier parents.
Task: probability the next child is affected.
