<p>
Dilutions are a high-leverage pattern in life science because the story is authentic, the numbers
are realistic, and grading can be made robust with explicit units and tolerances.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Serial dilutions (1:2, 1:10, etc.).</li>
	<li>Preparing a working concentration from a stock.</li>
	<li>Standard curve setup questions where the series values matter more than the plot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks when the content is biology</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Students mix up dilution factor vs final concentration.</li>
	<li>Units drift (mL vs &mu;L, mg/mL vs &mu;g/mL) unless the prompt is explicit.</li>
	<li>Repeating decimals create rounding disputes unless values are constrained.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PGML-first prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Story: You prepare a 1:10 dilution series from a 2.0 mg/mL stock.
Data: factor, number of tubes, initial concentration.
Task: compute the concentration in tube 4 (mg/mL).
