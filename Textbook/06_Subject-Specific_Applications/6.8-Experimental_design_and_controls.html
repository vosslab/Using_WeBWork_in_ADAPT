<p>
Experimental design and controls are central to biology and are well-suited to multiple choice and
multiple answer items when the prompt is concrete. Reliable grading depends on clear definitions of
what a "control" is in the scenario.
</p>

<h2>Good fits for this pattern</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pick the best control for a stated confound (MC).</li>
	<li>Select which design changes fix a bias (MA).</li>
	<li>Match common controls to their purpose (MATCH).</li>
</ul>

<h2>What breaks in practice</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Vague prompts: "What is the control?" without describing the confound.</li>
	<li>Multiple plausible controls when the criterion is not stated.</li>
	<li>Items become opinion questions unless the prompt anchors the decision to a specific threat
		to validity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prompt outline</h2>
<pre>
Story: treatment vs vehicle in a cell assay.
Task: which control isolates the effect of the active compound?
