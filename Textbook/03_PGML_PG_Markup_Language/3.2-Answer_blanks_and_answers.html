<p>
Answer blanks are the center of most WeBWorK problems. In PGML, blanks are written as
<code>[_____]</code> and the correct answer can be attached immediately after the blank using
braces.
</p>

<h2>Basic numeric blank</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
The value is [______]{12}
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Expression and formula blanks</h2>
<p>
If the correct answer is a formula, use a quoted string or a Formula MathObject.
</p>

<pre>
$f = Compute("x^2-1");

BEGIN_PGML
[`y = `] [________________]{$f}
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Why attach answers to blanks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The grading rule stays next to the text that asks for it.</li>
	<li>Multi-part science prompts are easier to maintain.</li>
	<li>It reduces the chance of mismatching answer order and prompt order.</li>
</ul>
