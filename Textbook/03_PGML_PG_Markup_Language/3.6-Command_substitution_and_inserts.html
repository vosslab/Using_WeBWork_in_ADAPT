<p>
Command substitution lets you run a small Perl expression and insert its output into the PGML
prompt. This is useful for inserting images, computed strings, or helper-generated markup.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
[@ some_perl_expression() @]
</pre>

<p>
If the substitution produces output that is already formatted as PG/HTML, follow it with a star:
</p>

<pre>
[@ some_perl_expression() @]*
</pre>

<h2>Common uses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Insert a computed intermediate value into a worked solution line.</li>
	<li>Insert a table or figure generated by helper functions.</li>
	<li>Use a specialized PG helper when PGML does not provide a direct syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example: computed text inside math mode</h2>
<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
To solve [: x + [$a] = [$b] x :], subtract [:x:] from both sides to get
[: [$a] = ([$b]-1) x = [@ $b - 1 @] x :].
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Images and links (LibreTexts constraint)</h2>
<p>
Images can be inserted via helper functions and command substitution, but the textbook content in
this repository avoids HTML links because LibreTexts provides its own table of contents and
in-platform navigation. Keep prompts self-contained and do not rely on linking out to other pages.
</p>

<p>
Treat this as an advanced escape hatch: keep substitutions small, readable, and easy to test.
