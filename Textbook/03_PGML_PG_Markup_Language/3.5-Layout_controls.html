<p>
Layout controls can improve readability for longer prompts, but fragile formatting is one of the
fastest ways to create problems that render differently across systems. Prefer simple structure
(headings, lists, and tables) and treat layout controls as an optional finishing touch.
</p>

<h2>Headings (structure)</h2>
<p>
Headings help students scan a multi-part prompt. In PGML, headings are written with
<code>#</code> characters at the start of a line.
</p>

<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
# Data
## Tasks
### Report
END_PGML
</pre>

<h2>Emphasis (bold and italic)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bold: <code>*bold*</code></li>
	<li>Italic: <code>_italic_</code></li>
	<li>Bold italic: <code>*_bold italic_*</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Use emphasis to highlight the task being asked and the reporting expectations (units, rounding),
not to decorate the story.
</p>

<h2>Horizontal rules (sparingly)</h2>
<p>
Horizontal rules can separate major blocks, but headings are usually clearer.
</p>

<h2>Justification and centering (rare)</h2>
<p>
PGML supports simple right-justification and centering syntax. These are occasionally useful for a
short "report" block, but they can be fragile and are easy to overuse.
</p>

<pre>
BEGIN_PGML
>> Right-justified line

>> centered <<
END_PGML
</pre>
